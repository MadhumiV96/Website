   <h4>1)  Who will be helping me?</h4>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>After you sign up, we will match you to an available counselor who fits your objectives, preferences, and the type of issues you are dealing with. Different counselors have different approaches and areas of focus, so it's important to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you. We have found that we are able to provide a successful match most of the time; however, if you start the process and you feel your counselor isn't a good fit for you, you may elect to be matched to a different counselor.    </p>
      <p> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4>2) Who are the counselors?</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
      Counselors on BetterHelp are licensed, trained, experienced, and accredited psychologists (PhD / PsyD), marriage and family therapists (LMFT), clinical social workers (LCSW / LMSW), or licensed professional counselors (LPC). All of them have a Masters Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their field. They have been qualified and certified by their state's professional board after successfully completing the necessary education, exams, training and practice. While their experience, expertise and background vary, they all possess at least 3 years and 2,000 hours of hands-on experience.

    <h4> 3) Is TalkMate right for me?</h4>
<blockquote>
      <p>
        
        
      TalkMate may be right for you if you're looking to improve the quality of your life. Whenever there is anything that interferes with your happiness or prevents you from achieving your goals, we may be able to help. We also have counselors who are specialized in specific issues, such as stress, anxiety, relationships, parenting, depression, addictions, eating, sleeping, trauma, anger, family conflicts, LGBT matters, grief, religion, self esteem and more. <br />
        <br />
        TalkMate is <strong>not</strong> the right solution for you if any of the following is true:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You have thoughts of hurting yourself or others</li>
        <li>You are a minor or you are under the care of a legal guardian</li>
        <li>You are in an urgent crisis or an emergency situation</li>
        <li>You have been diagnosed with a severe mental illness, or if you have been advised to be in psychological supervision or psychiatric care</li>
        <li>You were required to undergo therapy or counseling either by a court order or by any other authority</li>
        <li>You do not have a device that can connect to the Internet or you do not have a reliable Internet connection</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
      
   <h4>4) How will I communicate with my counselor?</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
    You can get counseling in four ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Exchanging messages</strong> with your counselor</li>
      <li><strong>Chatting live</strong> with your counselor</li>
      <li><strong>Speaking over the phone</strong> with your counselor</li>
      <li><strong>Video conferencing</strong> with your counselor</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You can use different ways at different times as you wish, based on your needs, availability, and convenience.

  <h4>5) How long can I use TalkMate?</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
    This depends on your needs and varies a lot from one person to another. Some people feel they get most of the value after just a few weeks, while others prefer to stick to the program for an extended period of time. This is completely up to you.
      
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
 <h4> 6) What is the role of TalkMate.com?</h4>
 <blockquote>
   <p>
   The service is provided by independent providers who work directly with you. These providers are not employees of BetterHelp and the site doesn't oversee them professionally. Our mission is to build, maintain, and support a platform that lets users and counselors communicate effectively, and to facilitate this channel so they can get the most out of their interaction.
     
   </p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
 </blockquote>
 <h4> 7) How is my privacy protected?</h4>
<blockquote>
   <p>
   We are totally obsessed about securing your privacy and confidentiality. We have built a state-of-the-art technology, operation, and infrastructure with one thing in mind: protecting your privacy and safeguarding the information you provide. Our privacy and confidentiality standards are by far more advanced than what is required by law or regulations, so you can feel safe and comfortable.
   </p>
  <ul>
     <li>You don't need to identify yourself .</li>
     <li>Everything you tell your counselor is protected by strict federal and state laws.</li>
     <li>We don't cooperate or work with any insurance companies or employers, so nothing needs to be shared, reported or filed with them.</li>
     <li>You can always click the &quot;Shred&quot; button next to each message that you've sent so it will no longer show in your account.</li>
     <li>All the messages between you and your counselor are secured and encrypted by banking-grade 256-bit encryption.</li>
     <li>Our servers are hosted in an &quot;A Grade&quot; facility, ensuring the best-in-class security and protection.</li>
     <li>Our browsing encryption system (SSL) follows modern best practices, providing world class online security and encryption.</li>
     <li>Our databases are encrypted and scrambled so they essentially become useless in the very unlikely event that they are being stolen or inappropriately used.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you wish for any of your information or records to be released to a third party, please let your counselor know. Your counselor will send you an authorization form that you will need to fill and sign before your information can be released.
    </div>
     
  </p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
 </blockquote>
 <h4>8) Can I stay anonymous?</h4>
 <blockquote>
   <p>
   When you sign up we do not ask you for your full name or contact information. You may pick any &quot;nick name&quot; which will identify you in the system. When you decide to start the counseling process, we will ask you for emergency contact information which is kept safe in the system so it can be used if your counselor believes that you or someone else might be in danger.
